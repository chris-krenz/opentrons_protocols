# Contributing to DAMPLab Opentrons Protocols
Thank you for contributing to the DAMP Lab protocol repository! Please follow the guidelines below to keep the repo organized and consistent.
## Submission Workflow
1. Fork this repository by clicking the Fork button in the top right corner of the repo page on GitHub. This creates your own personal copy of the repo under your GitHub account.
2. Create a branch in your fork: `git checkout -b your-protocol-name`
3. Add your files to your branch following the folder structure and naming conventions below.
4. Open a Pull Request by clicking Contribute → Open a Pull Request on your fork. Provide a short title and description of what your protocol does.
5. Wait for approval. A maintainer will review your PR and either approve it to be merged or leave comments requesting changes.
> ⚠️ Do not attempt to push directly to `main`; it is protected and your push will be rejected.
## Adding a Protocol
Place each protocol in its own folder under `protocols/OT-2/` or `protocols/OT-Flex/`.
Each protocol folder under `protocols/OT-Flex/` should include:
- A `.py` protocol file
- A `README.md`
  - Overview of the protocol/kit used.
  - Robot hardware used.
  - Protocol validation (tests to validate the protocol works.)
  - Protocol updates (record of major updates/changes to the code and why they were implemented.)
- Input files (e.g., `.xlsx`), if needed
- Custom labware (if specific to that protocol)
Each protocol folder under `protocols/OT-Flex/ColonyPlayground/` should include:
- A `.py` protocol file
- A `README.md`
  - Link to the `README.md` for the protocol in the `protocols/OT-Flex/` folder.
- Input files (e.g., `.xlsx`), if needed
**Robotics Colony Members:**
Place shared/draft work in folders in `protocols/OT-Flex/ColonyPlayground/` and prefix folders with your BU username, semester, and year (e.g., `jsmith_fall_2025`).
Work chosen to be developed into a working/validated protocol should go in `protocols/OT-Flex/`.
## README.md Format and Guidelines
Format:
- Overview: Basic information about the protocol, and the kit used, if applicable.
  - If the protocol is in progress or not validated, add a warning label at the top stating so. 
- Protocol Hardwares: List hardware attached to the robot used, like modules, module adapters, pipettes, etc., and a link to the protocols.io materials section. 
- Protocol Summary
  - Robot Set-up: How to use and set up the protocol using the .py file and the Opentrons app.
  - Procedure: Link to protocols.io protocol procedure
- Custom Labware Required: Permalink to the custom labware .json used in the protocol.
- Protocol Validation: How to validate the code to know it gives usable data/results.
- Protocol Updates: Record of major changes made to the code and why. 
Other information/instructions, like consumables, labware, growing cell cultures, validating cell cultures, using other instruments (Nanodrop, plate reader), interpreting lab data, etc., will be kept in protocols.io.
## Custom Labware
- Shared labware definitions (used by multiple protocols) should be placed in `custom_labware/`
- Do not duplicate shared labware definitions unless absolutely necessary
## Naming Conventions
- Use lowercase with underscores for folder and file names
- Protocol file name should match the folder name
- Labware files should be clearly named and include volume if applicable (e.g., `greiner_96_deep_wellplate_2000ul.json`)
- Name protocol folders descriptively to avoid conflicts
## General Guidelines
- OT-2 protocols go in `protocols/OT-2/`
- OT-Flex protocols go in `protocols/OT-Flex/`
- Every protocol folder must include a `README.md`
- Keep shared resources in their designated folders to avoid duplication
- Use clear, descriptive commit messages. [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format is encouraged but not required (e.g., `docs: update README`, `feat: add new OT-2 protocol`)
