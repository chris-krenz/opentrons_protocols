# Pierce Dilution-Free Rapid Gold BCA Protein Assay Kit (OT-Flex)

## Overview
This protocol performs automated protein quantification using the Pierce Gold BCA Assay Kit in a 96-well plate format. This protocol can process 96 samples per run using the Opentrons Flex liquid handler, equipped with a 1000 uL 8-channel and 50 uL 1-channel pipette. The protocol is flexible, allowing unique combinations of unknowns and replicates. The Assay Kit has a working range of 20 to 10,000 μg/mL.

## Parameters
>[!IMPORTANT]
>The required liquid volumes displayed on the Flex are the minimum. Perfect liquid dispersion may not always be guaranteed, so it is suggested to follow the amount specified in the protocol on protocols.io.

1. Sample Count: Enter the total number of samples to be run, excluding replicates and excluding unknowns. 
2. Sample Replicates: Enter the number of replicates per sample.

### Labware Required
This protocol requires the following custom labware:

[custom_labware/nunc_96_wellplate_optical_bottom_400ul.json](https://github.com/bingling-w/opentrons_protocols/blob/4070e261d453abb1e0a81ed08c07d66fa3a36a12/custom_labware/nunc_96_wellplate_optical_bottom_400ul.json)

## Automated Procedure Walk-Through
1. The 50uL 1-channel pipette is used to pick up a 50uL tip.
2. The 50uL pipette is used to aspirate 10 uL of standards in the first row first column of the standards tube rack.
3. The 10 uL of standards is dispensed into the first row first column of the 96 well plate.
4. If replicates > 1: The pipette will aspirate 10 uL x # of replicates and consolidate 10 uL into the first row first column, and then the columns next to it. 
5. The used tip is discarded.
6. Step 1-5 is repeated for the 8 standards in the tube rack.
7. The 50uL 1-channel pipette is used to pick up a 50uL tip.
8. The 50uL pipette is used to aspirate 10 uL of unknowns in the first row first column of the unknowns tube rack.
9. The 10 uL of unknowns is dispensed into the first row of the column next to the standards.
10. If replicates > 1: The pipette will aspirate 10 uL x # of replicates and consolidate 10 uL into the first row column next to the standards, and then the column next to where the final unique unknown would be placed.  
11. The used tip is discarded.
12. Step 7-11 is repeated for the number of unknowns in the tube rack. 

## Protocol Validation Runs
- $R^2$ value close to 1, signaling strong correlation between absorbance and concentration values.
- Food coloring validation:
  - Using 10% glycerol, do a serial dilution with red food coloring as standards.
  - Add red coloring to reagent B, and use 10% glycerol as reagent A.
  - Do an automated and manual run of the protocol.
  - Compare the standard curves of the two; the slopes of both should be close when using the same standards.


## Protocol Updates
- Ver. 13: Increased the number of unknown samples allowed for 3 replicates, and added an extra rack of 200 uL tips for when the unknown number exceeds 16 and replicates equal 3, to prevent running out of tips. When reagent B volume exceeds 150 uL, switches to a 200 uL tip using the 8-channel pipette for quicker transfer (wastes 8 more tips, but is much more efficient when reagent B volume is high). 
- Ver. 12: Includes flexible input for changing module locations and changing pipette locations (left or right mount) to further simplify the process, especially for new users. 
- Ver. 11: Includes flexible input for v-bottom or diamond-bottom wells, accessible for users with different labware. 
- Ver. 10: Changed flow rate to be even slower, and added correct dead volume for working reagent. Slower flow rate results in more accurate pipetting, and the correct dead volume reduces liquid waste.
- Ver. 9: Code is made to blow out, touch tip, and blow out again to account for the viscosity of unknowns and standards, to prevent droplets. 
- Ver. 8: Code is optimized to dispense and aspirate more slowly for more accurate pipetting. 
- Ver. 7: Code is optimized to use small-volume pipette arms and tips to minimize the machine's % error.
- Ver. 6: Code is optimized to use a partial nozzle setup for the 8-channel pipette when there is not a full column, to reduce reagent waste and tip waste.
- Ver. 5: Code is made so the pipette goes to the very bottom of the reservoir to reduce dead volume. 
- Ver. 4: Code is optimized to distribute reagent B uniformly across the reservoir, and mixed with reagent A at different heights for a more uniform mixture. 
- Ver. 2: Code contains mixing and blow-out steps, though it does not mix as well because the tip can mix a maximum of 50 uL volumes. 
- Ver. 1: Code is optimized for flexibility, allowing the user to change the protocol based on how many replicates and unknowns are necessary.
